About me
======

Academical
------

I am a PhD candidate at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl). I've completed my studies in Computer Sciences and Engineering at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Italy in 2019; the thesis is entitled [_"CARONTE: a Crawler for Adversarial Resources Over Non Trusted, high-profile Environments"_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8802484) and has been published in the proceedings of the [1st Workshop on Attackers and Cyber-Crime Operations (WACCO)](https://www.wacco-workshop.eu/past/2019/index.html) held at IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy 2019 in Stockholm, Sweden.

My research interests aim at characterizing emerging threats that rely from blackmarket provisioning to build their offense. 

To this extent, my efforts address the discovery of emerging undeground criminal business models and how they're framed into the criminal supply-chain, their provisioning capability for an arbitrary threat actor, [the circumvention of adversarial countermeasures to investigation and infiltration in blackmarkets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8802484), and the attribution of illegal products and services available across the markets. 

Personal
------

In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, trekking in the nature and playing piano and CTFs on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu); my handle is [alphacentauri](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/11532). With some friends, we have [a blog](https://highwaytoroot.github.io) where we (seldom) publish writeups of the boxes we own.
