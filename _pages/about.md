I am a curious and passionate individual interested in the cybercriminal ecosystem supporting attacks at scale (_my full CV [here](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/files/Michele_Campobasso_CV.pdf)_).

In September 2019, I began my PhD at the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) of [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl) under the supervision of [dr. Luca Allodi](https://lallodi.github.io/), and in March 2024 I defended my PhD thesis titled ["Understanding and Characterizing the Cybercriminal Ecosystem Enabling Attack Innovation at Scale"](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/publication/2024-03-07-thesis). In my work, I integrate concepts from economics and criminology to characterize cybercriminal marketplaces fostering innovation and enabling attacks at scale to identify those posing more damaging real-world threats.

I've completed my studies cum laude in Computer Sciences and Engineering at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Italy in 2019; the [thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8802484) has been published in the proceedings of the [1st Workshop on Attackers and Cyber-Crime Operations (WACCO)](https://www.wacco-workshop.eu/past/2019/index.html) held at IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy 2019 in Stockholm, Sweden.

<h3>Research overview</h3>

My research focuses on [how cybercriminal communities support the provisioning of offensive cyber capabilities for an arbitrary threat actor](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/whitepapers/2021-03-01-proliferation-primer), leading to the [discovery of emerging underground criminal business models](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/publication/2020-11-10-impaas) and to the [derivation of attacker preferences to characterize victims and inform a cyber-risk model](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/publication/2023-08-09-impaas-economy). To achieve this, I study how to [circumvent adversarial countermeasures to investigation and infiltration in blackmarkets](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/publication/2022-11-24-threatcrawl). Thanks to the collected data and to the achieved foodhold in tenths of cybercriminal communities, I propose an [evaluation framework for cybercriminal marketplaces supporting attack innovation](https://michelecampobasso.github.io/publications/2023-07-05-underground-relevance).

Personal
------

In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, cycling through North Brabant (NL), hiking, tinkering (I'm on a mission to repair everything I can), playing piano and CTFs on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu); my handle is [alphacentauri](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/11532). With some friends, we have [a blog](https://highwaytoroot.github.io) where we <s>(seldom)</s> _used to_ publish writeups of the boxes we own on HackTheBox.
